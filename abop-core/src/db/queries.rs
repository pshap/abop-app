//! Database query definitions for ABOP
//!
//! This module contains the SQL queries used by the database module.
//! Each query is stored in a separate file for better maintainability.

// Note: SQL query constants were removed as they were not being used.
// SQL queries are now embedded directly in the repository implementations
// or loaded as needed. This reduces unnecessary compile-time overhead.
