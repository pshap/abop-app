//! Configuration types for the casting builder
//!
//! This module defines the configuration types used by the `CastingBuilder` to control
//! how numeric conversions are performed. These settings allow fine-tuning of precision,
//! overflow handling, rounding behavior, and validation levels for different use cases.

/// Precision handling mode for numeric conversions
///
/// Controls how strictly numeric precision is maintained during conversions.
/// Different modes are suitable for different use cases:
///
/// - `Strict`: Best for financial calculations and database operations
/// - `Tolerant`: Good for audio processing where minor precision loss is acceptable
/// - `Adaptive`: Ideal for UI calculations where performance is important
